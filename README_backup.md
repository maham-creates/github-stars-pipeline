# GitHub Gems: Driving Open-Source Investments With Data

Welcome to the GitHub Gems project! This project hosts a data analytics pipeline that enables smarter investment decisions by measuring the popularity of open-source repos on Github.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop an efficient data pipeline that streamlines analytics, reduces manual effort, and enables deeper insights into the open-source ecosystem on GitHub. By leveraging modern data tools such as dbt (data build tool) and best practices such as dimensional modeling, we aim to create a scalable and reliable solution for data-driven decision-making.

## Getting Started

To get started with the GitHub Gems project, follow these steps (click on the
links for guides):

### Set up your IDE

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Skip some steps if you're already set!
>
> If you already have git, VSCode, and/or Python installed, just skip the corresponding step(s).

1. [Install git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

2. If you don't have a coding editor installed, [install VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). After that, [install the Python and Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python#_install-python-and-the-python-extension).

3. If you don't have Python 3 installed, [install it here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Create your personal repo

1. [Create a new repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository) in your Github account and name it `github-stars-pipeline`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure not to create your own README file when Github asks you!**

2. Clone this repo.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/edsioufi/github-stars-pipeline.git
```


3. Point your local clone to your own remote (so that you can modify your copy of the repo, not the template). Make sure you replace `{your_github_username}` with the corresponding value.

```bash
cd github-stars-pipeline
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/{your_github_username}/github-stars-pipeline.git
```

4. Push to your new github repo.

```bash
git push origin main
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure you don't skip this step of pushing to main before proceeding, otherwise you won't find your main branch in your repo!

### Set up your python environment and DuckDB

1. Create a python virtual environment for your repo:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. [Install DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/installation/?version=stable&environment=python) (make sure you select the Python option), your first python dependency.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è You might have to install additional dependencies if you're on Windows.

3. [Install DBeaver](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/sql_editors/dbeaver.html) to explore DuckDB.

4. Create a new git branch:
```bash
git checkout -b add_duck_db
```

5. Add your newly installed packages to your requirements file:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

6. Commit and push:
```bash
git add --all
git commit
git push origin -u add_duck_db
```

7. [Create a Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request#creating-the-pull-request) in Github.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Choose your own `main` branch as the base, as we want to make each individual repo indepedent from this initial template repo.

> üí°Ô∏è When naming a PR, try to choose an informative name that clearly reflects the changes made, e.g. "Fix bug X", "Refactor funcion F", or "Add feature A".

8. Request a review from @edsioufi. You might need to [add me as a collaborator](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository#inviting-a-collaborator-to-a-personal-repository) to your repo first.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Do not merge your PR before it is reviewed and approved!

9. [Merge your first PR](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/incorporating-changes-from-a-pull-request/merging-a-pull-request#merging-a-pull-request).
